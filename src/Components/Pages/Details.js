            <h1>TLDR;</h1>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '18px' }}>As a child I was obsessed with Computers!</p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '18px' }}>Since then I have strived to learn everything I could about building them, fixing them, connecting them together and building software for them to run. </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '18px' }}>With my passion for self improvement and learning, I gave myself a mission of learning everything that would be required for any business to run. </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '18px' }}>Through this journey, I have mastered the skills for any modern business to succeed! Over the past 15 years I have been focused on helping small and
                medium business grow or make the jump to enterprise.</p>
            <br />
            <h1 id="LIFE">Life</h1>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '14px' }}>In my late teens I was introduced to Japanese Jiu Jitsu (Hisho Can Ryu) by my First Sensei Richard Laroche. It opened my eyes and set me on a journey
                in the world of Martial Arts</p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '14px' }}>From there, I branched out and tried just about everything from Kyokushin Karate to Catch-as-can-Wrestling. I was also exposed to weapon systems and
                settled on mastering edged combatives.</p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '14px' }}>Which for a time, I instructed to private defense contractors all the way to the Canadian Federal Corrrection Department. </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '14px' }}>After retiring from that work, I and a few of my training mates opened our own club in Chilliwhack, BC called Chilliwhack JiuJitsu & MMA.
                Which ran for over 5 years. Only closing due to the Covid Pandemic. ðŸ˜”</p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '14px' }}>All the while, I had developed a very rich and full family life!</p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '14px' }}>I have 4 daughters and 1 son ranging in age from 17 all the way down to 5 year old! [2022]</p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '14px' }}>I have been <strong>very blessed</strong> with a Loving wife and Healthy children! </p>
            <br />
            <h1 id="TECH">Technologies</h1>

            <p style={{ fontSize: '14px' }}>I was first exposed to the IT world as a teenager. My bestfriends father ran a small VAR.  He would pay us in computer parts to do system builds and repairs.
                which at the time (1993-1995) was an amazing way to get access to both the hardware and software to run a PC!</p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '14px' }}>From there my passion for computers spread. I owned an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Atari 1040 STe</a> which
                was the first place I got to write code! (GFA-BASIC). This was a game changer. It showed me both how to operate and develope for a platform for the first time. The first thing
                I tried to do, was program my own version of Dragon Warrior. I am happy to report for a 15 year old, it was decent! Then from all of my work, I was able to get a 80286 my first PC
                compatible clone! (What they were called at time, now we just call them PC's)</p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '14px' }}>This introduced me to MS-DOS (3 - 6.1) and Windows For Workgroups.  Which started me on the journey that has lead me to where I am today. Once I realized you
                could play games on a PC I was obsessed, this lead to a few key moments.  Modems and Networking! I immediately started saving every penny I could to buy my own 9600 baud modem and
                a more powerful PC (80486 DX).  When I did, I was able to start connecting to BBS's! These were pre-internet bulletin boards that allowed for you to download files, play games and send
                messages to people all around the world!</p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '14px' }}>Once I was on the pre-cursor to the internet I started to see how this kind of connectivity would eventually spread and become accessible to everbody.
                It was also the first time, I was able to access data which was hard to find. Things like books on programming, networking and IT Operations! Which I used right way when I got a
                chance to work as a Bench tech at Sudden Service!</p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '14px' }}>From there, my exposure and access to real skills exploded!  I started like all techs in this era.  Learning basic systems building and design.
                Installation and configuration of desktop operating systems (win95,98SE) as well as commerical OS's such as NT 4.0 and Windows Server 2000. I then set on a path to get the
                required certifications of the time!  I started with my <strong>A+</strong> cert, then a brand new cert called <strong>Network+</strong>. Both of these I got in the upper 90% range.
                I then moved on to my <strong>MCP</strong> certification, and then finally (at the time the one that mattered) my <strong>MCSE</strong> certification!   </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '14px' }}>Once I had gotten a taste for self-study and certifiction, I started work on a several industry standard cert for specific brands and platforms
                such as warranty repair work for HP, Toshiba, and a few that no longer exsist! I branched into PBX work! Learning how to setup PBX's on platforms such as NEC and Panasonic.
                Exposure to low voltage cabling came next, learning how to terminate and install all the way from RJ-11 to Cat6. The company I worked for at the time got a contract for a
                10,000 drop installation at University of British Columbia, of which a solid portion was completed by me.</p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '14px' }}>Around this time, I had also upped my programming skils, making standalone utility apps in C#. This first started out of an attempt to automate
                many repetive tasks associated with my duties at the time. Once my first exe compiled and ran on another machine, I was hooked.  From there, I started seeking out problems to
                solve at ever job I have ever worked at since! </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '14px' }}>
                This also set me on another quest!  However, in the programming space there isn't quite the same certifiction path, as you see with IT.  I have however taken over 1000 hours of
                developement training courses on many platforms! Some of which offer 'certifiction'. I am super passionate about programming in general and it has in alot of ways dominated my
                focus for the last few years!
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '14px' }}>
                So that is a very brief overview of how I got here, and the path I took! Below I have created a matrix of all the skills I have developed over the years.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '14px' }}> Thank you,</p>

            <p>To be succesful in the field of I.T Requires many things. A passion for continious learning, an open mind and the desire to find new tools being key. Over the years,
                I have sharpened my axe in many ways, below is a short list of these skills. This only represents a portion of my knowledge and skills, but they are the key ones.
                I have rated them out of 10</p>
